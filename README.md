DSA Practice Repository:

Overview
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! This repository contains solutions to various DSA problems that I solve regularly. The goal is to enhance problem-solving skills, deepen understanding of algorithms, and prepare for coding interviews.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into different folders, each dedicated to a specific data structure or algorithm. Here's a basic outline:

├── Arrays/
├── LinkedLists/
├── Stacks/
├── Queues/
├── Trees/
├── Graphs/
├── Sorting/
├── Searching/
├── DynamicProgramming/
├── GreedyAlgorithms/
└── Miscellaneous/
Each folder contains:

Problem Statements: A brief description of the problem.
Solution Code: The implementation of the solution in Python (or your preferred language).
Complexity Analysis: Time and space complexity of the solution.
Languages Used
Python (Primary)

Tips for Customization:
Personalization: Modify the sections according to your specific workflow, problem categorization, and coding style.
Additional Information: You might want to add sections on tools, IDEs, or specific patterns you follow.
Project Tracking: If you are following a specific curriculum or challenge (like 30 Days of Code), you can mention it.
Badges: Add more badges if you're using CI/CD tools, or if you want to display things like the number of stars or forks.
This template is a solid starting point, and you can always expand it as your repository grows.# DSA-in-Python
